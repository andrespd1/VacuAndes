## What is this?

This is an in-class project developed in the course of Transactional Systems, where we learned about SQL and its implementation with Java. This app is a system that looks to help the government make possible the distribution of vaccines and the control of them in Colombia for the COVID-19 pandemic situation. So with this objective, we developed a Java project that allows us to interact correctly with a database, allowing transactional support for avoiding errors in the data and being the most accurate possible with all the vaccines and its status.

We had a problem with the repository, so this repository only has one commit message. This is because we previously had a repository where all the project have been developed, but we deleted due to a problem that corrupted all the files in it. So this is a recovery version we submit as part of our development for the project.

## What we have used to built this app?
